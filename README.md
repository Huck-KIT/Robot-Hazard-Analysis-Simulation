# Robot-Hazard-Analysis-Simulation
## Introduction
This example shows how simulation of collaborative robot workflows can be used to uncover potential hazards for the human worker. It is motivated by the problem of design-time risk assessment of robot systems. The main research questions that are addressed by this example are:
1. How can we use simulation to identify potential hazards in an early development stage (i.e., before the system is built and commissioned in real life)?
2. How can we identify hazardous worker behaviors that are likely to cause unsafe states wen performed in interaction with the robot system?

## Prerequisites
This example was developed using Ubuntu 18.04 and CoppeliaSim 4.2). To run this example, you need:
- CoppeliaSim 4.2 or newer (available [here](https://www.coppeliarobotics.com/downloads))
- The Lua Library "String Distance" (Install from [here](http://www.ccpa.puc-rio.br/software/stringdistance/) and place the resulting library file 'stringdistance.so' in the CoppeliaSim installation folder)
- Python 2.7 or newer
